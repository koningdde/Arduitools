The Black Bra

I had lunch with 2 of my unmarried friends. One is engaged, one is a mistress, and I have been married for
20+ years.

We were chatting about our relationships and decided to amaze our men by greeting them at the door wearing
a black bra, stiletto heels and a mask over our eyes. We agreed to meet in a few days to exchange notes.

Here's how it all went.

My engaged friend:

The other night when my boyfriend came over he found me with a black leather bodice, tall stilettos and a
mask.

He saw me and said, "You are the woman of my dreams. I love you." Then we made passionate love all night
long.

The mistress:

Me too! The other night I met my lover at his office and I was wearing a raincoat, under it only the black bra,
heels and a mask over my eyes. When I opened the raincoat he didn't say a word, but he started to tremble
and we had wild sex all night.

Then I had to share my story:

When my husband came home I was wearing the black bra, black stockings, stilettos and a mask over my
eyes.

When he came in the door and saw me he said:

"What's for dinner, Zorro?"
