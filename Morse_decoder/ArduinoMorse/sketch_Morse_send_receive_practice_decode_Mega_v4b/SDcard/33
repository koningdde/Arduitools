Married Division

A note found on the refrigerator one morning:

My Dear Wife,

You will surely understand that I have certain needs that you, being 54 years old, can no longer satisfy. 
I am very happy with you and I value you as a good wife.

Therefore, after reading this letter, I hope that you will not wrongly interpret the fact that I will be spending
the evening with my 18-year-old secretary at the Comfort Inn Hotel. Please don't be upset.

I shall be home before midnight.

When the man came home late that night, he found the following letter on the dining room table:

My Dear Husband,

I received your letter and thank you for your honesty about my being 54 years old. I would like to take this
opportunity to remind you that you are also 54 years old.

As you know, I am a math teacher at our local college. I would like to inform you that while you read this, I
will be at the Hotel Fiesta with Michael, one of my students, who is also the assistant tennis coach. He is
young, virile, and like your secretary, is 18-years-old.

As a successful businessman who has an excellent knowledge of math, you will understand that we are in the
same situation, although with one small difference, 18 goes into 54 a lot more times than 54 goes into 18.

Therefore, I will not be home until sometime next week.
