Four Jewish brothers left home for college, and they became successful doctors
and lawyers and prospered.

Some years later, they chatted after having dinner together. They discussed
the gifts that they were able to give to their elderly mother who lived far
away in another city.

The first said, "I had a big house built for Mama."

The second said, "I had a hundred thousand dollar theater built in the house."

The third said, "I had my Mercedes dealer deliver her an S600 with a
chauffeur."

The fourth said, "Listen to this. You know how Mama loved reading the Torah
and you know she can't read it anymore because she can't see very well. I met
this Rabbi who told me about a parrot that can recite the entire Torah. It
took twenty rabbis 12 years to teach him. I had to pledge to contribute
$100,000 a year for twenty years to the temple, but it was worth it. Mama just
has to name the chapter and verse and the parrot will recite it."

The other brothers were impressed.

After the holidays Mom sent out her thank you notes. She wrote: "Milton, the
house you built is so huge. I live in only one room, but I have to clean the
whole house. Thanks anyway."

"Marvin, I am too old to travel. I stay home, I have my groceries delivered,
so I never use the Mercedes...and the driver you hired is a Nazi. The thought
was good. Thanks."

"Menachim, you give me an expensive theater with Dolby sound, it could hold 50
people, but all my friends are dead, I've lost my hearing and I'm nearly
blind. I'll never use it. Thank you for the gesture just the same."

"Dearest Melvin, you were the only son to have the good sense to give a little
thought to your gift. The chicken was delicious. Thank you."
