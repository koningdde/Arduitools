The Hypnotist

It was entertainment night at the Senior Center. Carl, the hypnotist, exclaimed: "I'm here to put you all into a
trance - I intend to hypnotize each and every member of the audience."

The excitement was almost electric as Carl withdrew a beautiful antique pocket watch from his coat.

The polished metal gleamed in the light.

Carl, the hypnotist, said: "I want you each to keep your eyes on this antique watch. It's a very special watch.
It's been in my family for six generations."

He began to swing the watch gently back and forth while quietly chanting, "Watch the watch, watch the watch,
watch the watch."

The crowd became mesmerized as the watch swayed back and forth, light shimmering off its polished surface.
Hundreds of pairs of eyes followed the swaying watch, until, suddenly, it slipped from the hypnotist's fingers
and fell to the floor, shattering into a hundred pieces.

'SHIT!' said the Hypnotist.

It took 3 days to clean up the Senior Center.
