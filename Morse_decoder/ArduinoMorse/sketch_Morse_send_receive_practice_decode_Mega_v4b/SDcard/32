Make A Choice

Once upon a time, a Prince asked a beautiful Princess, "Will you marry me?"

The Princess said, "No!"

And the Prince lived happily ever after and rode motorcycles and banged skinny long-legged big-titted broads
and hunted and fished and raced cars and went to naked bars and dated women half his age and drank
whiskey, beer and Captain Morgan and never heard bitching and never paid child support or alimony and
banged cheerleaders and kept his house and guns and ate spam and potato chips and beans and blew
enormous farts and never got cheated on while he was at work and all his friends and family thought he was
feaikin' cool as hell and he had tons of money in the bank and left the toilet seat up.

The end.
