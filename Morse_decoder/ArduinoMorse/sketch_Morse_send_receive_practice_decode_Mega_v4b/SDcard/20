My First Condom

I recall my first time with a condom. I was 16. I went in to buy a packet of condoms at Parchen's pharmacy. In
those days it took a lot of guts to go in a store and ask for that kind of item because everyone in town knew
me and there was no doubt the young lady (I think her name was Katie) knew what they were for.

She was working as an assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was really embarrassed by the
whole procedure. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, "No,
not really."

So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it
was on tight and secure

I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it were empty. It was. "Just a
minute," she said, and walked to the door and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room,
unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. "Do these excite you?" She
asked.

Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was stand there with my mouth open and nod my head. She
then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her
panties and lay down on a desk. "Well, come on", she said, "We don't have much time."

So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful that, unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOW, I was
done within a few moments.

She looked at me with a bit of a frown. "Did you put that condom on, Vince?" she asked. I said, "sure did," and
held up my thumb to show her.

She then beat the shit out of me. Women have always been hard for me to figure out.
