Three Girlfriends

Jan, Sue and Mary haven't seen each other since High School. They rediscover each other via a reunion website
and arrange to meet for lunch in a wine bar.

Jan arrives first, wearing beige Versace. She orders a bottle of Pinot Grigio. Sue arrives shortly afterward, in
gray Chanel. After the required ritualized kisses she joins Jan in a glass of wine. Then Mary walks in, wearing
a faded old tee-shirt, blue jeans and boots. She too shares the wine.

Jan explains that after leaving high school and graduating from Princeton in Classics, she met and married
Timothy, with whom she has a beautiful daughter. Timothy is a partner in one of New York's leading law firms.
They live in a 4000 sq ft co-op on Fifth Avenue, where Susanna, the daughter, attends drama school. They
have a second home in Phoenix.

Sue relates that she graduated from Harvard Med School and became a surgeon. Her husband, Clive, is a
leading Wall Street investment banker. They live in Southampton on Long Island and have a second home in
Naples, Florida.

Mary explains that she left school at 17 and ran off with her boyfriend, Mark. They run a tropical bird park in
Colorado and grow their own vegetables. Mark can stand five parrots, side by side, on his dick.

Halfway down the third bottle of wine and several hours later, Jan blurts out that her husband is really a
cashier at Wal-Mart. They live in a small apartment in Brooklyn and have a travel trailer parked at a nearby
storage facility.

Sue, chastened and encouraged by her old friend's honesty, explains that she and Clive are both nurses' aides
in a retirement home. They live in Jersey City and take vacation camping trips to Alabama.

Mary admits that the fifth parrot has to stand on one leg.
