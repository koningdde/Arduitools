Husband (a doctor) and his wife
are having a fight at the breakfast table.
Husband gets up in a rage and says,
"You're no good in bed either!" and storms out of the house.
After sometime, he realizes he was nasty
and decides to make amends and rings her up.
She comes to the phone after many rings,
and the irritated husband says,
"What took you so long to answer the phone?"
She says, "I was in bed."
"In bed this early, doing what?"
She says, "Getting a second opinion!"
