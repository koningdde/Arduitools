Dear Abby,

I am a crack dealer in Beaumont, Texas, who has recently been diagnosed as a carrier of HIV.  
My parents live in Fort Worth. One of my Sisters lives in Pflugerville and is married to a transvestite.

My father and mother have recently been arrested for growing and selling marijuana.  
They are financially dependent on my other two sisters, who are prostitutes in Dallas.

I have two brothers: one is currently serving a non-parole life sentence at Huntsville for the murder of 
a teenage boy in 1994. 
My other brother is currently in jail awaiting charges of sexual misconduct with his three children.

I have recently become engaged to marry a former prostitute who lives in Longview. She is a part time "working girl".

All things considered, my problem is this. I love my fiance and look forward to bringing her into the family.  
I certainly want to be totally open and honest with her.

Should I tell her about my cousin who is a jazz musician?

Signed, Worried About My Reputation
 
How many real jazz musicians do you know that this would impact?  
The rest of you are weekend interlopers with real jobs who dream of a former time.
