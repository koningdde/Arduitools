The town fathers were looking for a way to increase attendance and participation at their regular meetings. 
One member suggested bringing in a hypnotist. 
The officials agreed, a famous hypnotist was hired, publicity distributed, and everyone was pleased.

A few weeks later the meeting hall was packed, and the town's people sat fascinated as the hypnotist 
withdrew a pocket watch. The hypnotist began chanting... "Watch the watch, watch the watch, watch the watch."

The crowd became mesmerized as the watch swayed back and forth, light gleaming off its polished surface. 
Hundreds of pairs of eyes followed the swaying watch, until suddenly the hypnotist's fingers slipped and the watch 
fell to the floor.

"Shit" said the hypnotist.

It took three weeks to clean up the town hall.
