Senior Sex

There's an old couple, both in their 80's, on a sentimental holiday they went back to the spot where they first
met.

They're sitting in a pub and he says to her, "Do you recall the first time we had sex together, over fifty years
ago? We went behind the barn. You leaned against the fence and I made love to you."

"Yes," she says, "I remember it well."

"OK," he says, "How about a stroll round there again for old times sake?"

"Ooh Henry, you devil, that sounds like a good idea," she answers.

There's a policeman sitting at the next table listening to all this, having a chuckle to himself. He thinks, "I've
got to see this, two old timers having sex against a fence." So he follows them.

They walk haltingly along, aided by walking sticks. Finally they get to the back of the barn and make their way
to the fence. They strip off and lean back on the fence. Suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex the
watching man has ever seen. They are bucking and jumping like eighteen year olds. This goes on for about
forty minutes. Finally, they both collapse panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle
to their feet and put their clothes back on.

The guy, still watching thinks, that was truly amazing, he was going like a train. I've got to ask him what his
secret is.

As the couple pass, the policeman says to them, "That was something else, you must have been going at it
for about forty minutes. How do you manage it? Is there some sort of secret?"

"No, there's no secret," the old man says, "except fifty years ago that frigging fence wasn't electric."
