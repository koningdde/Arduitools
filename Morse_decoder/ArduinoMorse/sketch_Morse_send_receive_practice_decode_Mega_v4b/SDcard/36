No Soup For You

Little Dave comes down to breakfast.

Since they live on a farm, his mother asks if he had done his chores.

"Not yet," said Little Dave.

His mother tells him no breakfast until he does his chores.

Well, Little Dave is a little pissed off, so he goes to feed the chickens, and he kicks a chicken. He goes to feed
the cows, and he kicks a cow. He goes to feed the pigs, and he kicks a pig. He goes back in for breakfast and
his mother gives him a bowl of dry cereal.

"How come I don't get any eggs and bacon? Why don't I have any milk in my cereal?" he asks.

"Little Dave," his mother says, "I saw you kick a chicken, so you don't get any eggs for a week. I saw you kick
the pig, so you don't get any bacon for a week either. I saw you kick the cow so for a week you aren't getting
any milk."

Just then, his father Bill comes down for breakfast and kicks the cat halfway across the kitchen.

Dave looks up at his mother with a smile, and says, "You gonna tell him or should I?"
