transmit on that frequency.  the mfj 994brt and mfj998rt will retune and
store the new tuning data for that frequency only.  all other previously
stored memory locations will be unaffected.  tuner measurements i performed
resistive matching range and loss testing with a precision setup similar to
that used in the arrl lab.  this is a good way to systematically check an
auto tuners ability to match a wide variety of loads.  while resistive
matching tests are great for standard antenna tuner comparison testing,
remote tuners will experience maximum inductance and highest rf current
with short antennas, so antenna tuner losses can be higher under these
conditions.  to determine auto tuner losses in more real world conditions,
i built two antenna simulator circuits.  one is based on the tuners minimum
