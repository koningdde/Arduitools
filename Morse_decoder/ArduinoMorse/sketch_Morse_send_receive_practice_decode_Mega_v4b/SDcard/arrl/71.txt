early days of the new mode, the ssb rf signal was typically generated at 9
mhz.  that may seem an odd choice until you consider that if you mixed this
signal with the output of a vfo operating in a range from 5 to 5r5 mhz, you
could use the heterodyne method to combine the two signals and generate an
rf output on two bands.  it worked like this when you combined the 5 to 5r5
mhz vfo signal with the 9 mhz ssb signal the sum was a signal between 14
and 14r5 mhz, which provided coverage across the 20 meter band.  take the
difference instead and you get an output in the 80 meter band 3r5 to 4 mhz.
engineers quickly discovered that with the proper application of this
heterodyne sleight of hand, they could create a single circuit capable of
generating both the transmit and receive frequencies.  now a single radio,
