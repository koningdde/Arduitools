of latitude.  the nighttime hawaiian openings were almost always close to
the long path great circle headings to europe.  these headings are about 15
20 west of south.  small tpl footprints in europe the footprints of the
march tpl openings were small in europe.  they centered around slovenia and
the immediate surrounding countries.  on one evening, kh7y heard only
bulgaria.  this was a very small footprint for such a long path.  the small
size of the european footprint may be due to this being the same tep
footprint for the southern africa southern europe path.  this also suggests
regular tep is involved for the last part of the path.  the hawaiian tpl
contacts are also sensitive to the high latitude polar k index.  over 90 of
the hawaii contacts were made with a kp planetary k index of 1 or 0.
