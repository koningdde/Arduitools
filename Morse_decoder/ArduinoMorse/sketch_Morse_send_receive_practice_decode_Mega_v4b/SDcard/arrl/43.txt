with the spot function disabled, the voltage at the ritb connection on the
synthesizer board should be high when the key is down and low when the key
is up.  debug the rit keying circuit if necessary.  testing with the
transmitter connect the key jack of your transmitter to the appropriate
output of the keying circuit.  with your transmitter connected to a dummy
load, key the system.  your transmitter should function normally, and the
signal should be clean.  when judging the quality of your signal with your
own receiver be aware that receiver overload and saturation are likely to
generate spurious responses in the receiver that mask the true keying of
the transmitter signal.  getting on the air put the system on the air and
ask another remote ham operator for a critical signal quality report.
