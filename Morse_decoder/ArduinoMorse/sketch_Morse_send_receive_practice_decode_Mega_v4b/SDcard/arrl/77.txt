program starts when the download completes.  the running program sends a
serial message to the computer that indicates the decivolts read by the
voltmeter or the mw of the wattmeter measurement.  the monitor outputs are
leds connected to eleven output pins of the picaxe.  i got two decades of
monitor levels by using the eleventh led to indicate that the second decade
is in use.  i programmed mine to indicate 1/2 v intervals starting at 5 v.
at 10 v the eleventh led lights along with the zero to indicate 10 volts,
and eleventh led stays on like a tens digit as the voltage rises to 14 1/2
v.  this results in a range of 5 to 9 1/2 v, then with the eleventh led, 10
to 14 1/2 v in 1/2 v steps.  the analog input is digitized and scaled to
decivolts.  if the number is equal or larger than the monitor point, the
