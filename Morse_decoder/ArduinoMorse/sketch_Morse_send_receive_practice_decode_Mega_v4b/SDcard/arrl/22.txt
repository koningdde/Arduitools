the meter.  place the coil near the magnet but in a position where it
cannot contact the coil or the connecting wires.  wait for the magnet to
reach complete rest.  switch on the current while watching the magnet the
magnet will pivot and move, eventually stabilizing in a fixed position as
in figure 1.  my relay coil is drawing about 80 ma.  when you switch off
the current, the magnet will return to its original position.  the magnet
is moving so that its magnetic field is aligned with the magnetic field of
the energized coil.  cycle the current on and off several times.  the
magnet will always stabilize with one face of the magnet in the same
position.  slowly rotate the coil and verify that the magnet rotates to
follow the orientation of the coil.  reverse the power supply leads and
