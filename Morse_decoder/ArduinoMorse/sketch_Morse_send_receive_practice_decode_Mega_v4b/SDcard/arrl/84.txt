programs and services committee psc seeks member input on updating various
aspects of the leagues vhf uhf microwave and eme contest program.  in the
subcommittees solicitation for input, chairman kermit carlson, w9xa, said
members can help the work of the committee by providing additional insights
and ideas for our consideration.  contest participation benefits both
individual amateurs and the amateur radio service as a whole, said carlson,
who is arrl central division vice director.  individual operators gain
overall operating experience, increase their knowledge of band
characteristics, test the results of changes in equipment, antennas and
locations, and have incentive to add bands and modes to their station
complement, all in the context of enjoyable, yet challenging, activities.
