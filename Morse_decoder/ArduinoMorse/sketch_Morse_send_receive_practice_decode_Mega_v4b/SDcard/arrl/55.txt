diameter with a screw on lid.  a stainless steel screw through the top
serves as an anchor for the antenna and is connected to the inner lead of
an so 239 socket at the base of the abs pipe section.  the shield of the so
239 is connected to the ground block with heavy gauge metal.  the ground
radial system is a critical part of the antenna.  as an initial experiment
i used just two 65 foot pieces of insulated wire laid on the ground.  i was
able to tune the antenna and they actually worked quite well for
continental contacts.  however, for dx a more extensive ground system is
required and at present, i have 40 radials, each 20 to 80 feet long,
connected to the ground junction block.  the radials are 15 awg zinc coated
wire.  after burying the radials they were soon covered by the surrounding
