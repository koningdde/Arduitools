will find sufficient commentary, block diagrams, and waveform illustrations
to miss little of the meat of this book by going around the math.  the
basis and application of multiple types of time and frequency domain
instruments are presented, along with practical examples and expected
results.  in no sense is this book a substitute for the operating manuals
of particular measurement systems, but if read before attempting the
operation of them, it will make the applications and limitations of the
system type much more clear.  the author starts off with clear descriptions
of the relationships between time and frequency domain measurements and
follows with a refresher on the use of decibels in defining both voltage
and current ratios, the classic use, as well as the way decibels are used
