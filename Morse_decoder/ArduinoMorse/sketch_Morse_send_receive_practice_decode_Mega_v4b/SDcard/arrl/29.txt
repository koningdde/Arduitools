heading is oppositely directed.  had they been due to different local
environments for the pair of axis elements the asymmetry would have
persisted when the feeders were interchanged, this did not occur.  no
account was taken in the design of the delays introduced by the switching
matrix.  although they would be relatively small the path lengths through
the matrix were not equal for the four signals and depended on the pattern
of switch closures.  it is possible that this is a source of asymmetry and
a careful study of these pathways is needed.  there are strong indications
from modeling on a practical ground that the forward gain is between 7 and
8 dbi, but this needs to be confirmed by measurement and would require
reference to a standard antenna.  the loss between the common feed point
