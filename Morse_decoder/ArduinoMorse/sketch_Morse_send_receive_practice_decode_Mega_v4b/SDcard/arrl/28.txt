cross needle meter with scales for forward and reflected power, with swr
read at the intersection of the two needles.  then there are four 7 segment
led digital displays.  not visible in the photo is a bar graph display
along the top of the lcd information display.  you can measure forward and
reflected power as well as swr.  would you like that to be average or peak
power?  okay.  maybe you would like to subtract the reflected power from
the forward power, to display the actual power delivered to the load.
okay.  your choice of peak or average power will be displayed on the cross
needle analog meter.  would you prefer a 7 segment led digital display?
you can have that, too.  how about a simple bar graph for a quick visual
indication of any of those parameters?  the mb 1 has you covered.  but
