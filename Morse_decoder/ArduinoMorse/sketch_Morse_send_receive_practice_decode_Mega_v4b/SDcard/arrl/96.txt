the input of a signal generator can be harmful to the generator, but is
harmless when the ek1a is attached to an antenna.  make sure to turn on the
ek1a first and then hook up the signal generator to the antenna jack.
though the direct digital synthesizer dds frequency control is calibrated
at the factory, the next instruction explains how to calibrate the display
if needed by using a frequency counters output hooked to a small test point
on the main circuit board.  after the covers were in place, pete placed
four stick on rubber feet not included to keep the ek1a firmly on the bench
top.  arrl lab testing as shown in table 3, the receiver performance is
very good overall.  the ek1as lowest dynamic range at 2 khz is 80 db third
order imd dynamic range, better than some much more expensive transceivers
