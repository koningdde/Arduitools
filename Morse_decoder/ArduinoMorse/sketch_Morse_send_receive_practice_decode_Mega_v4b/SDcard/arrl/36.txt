many parts of north america to japan, china, taiwan, korea, and other far
east countries.  this can potentially add 10 15 more countries on 6 meters.
the stations that have had the best success on this mode are those with the
state of the art equipment, including at least one long yagi some with
large yagi stacks and high power.  stations such as james kesterson, k0gu
dn70, colorado and william hohnstein, k0ha en10, nebraska see figure 1 have
made some truly amazing contacts via this mode to china, taiwan, and other
far eastern countries.  trans equatorial propagation even in a grand
minimum, trans equatorial propagation tep will still occur around the
equinoxes across the geomagnetic equator.  it is a very robust mode.  but
the zone for working tep will move south and be smaller.  as i write this
