the coax.  for example, on 2 meters, if the swr were 5 1, the loss in 100
feet of rg 6 tv coax would be about 6 db.  this sounds bad, but the good
news is that at the bottom of the coax, the swr would be less than 2 1.
the resulting lower power at the antenna would also reduce the stress on
the balun.  this is the technique i use on my sailboat.  my 156 mhz marine
vhf antenna works fine on 2 meters due to the loss in the 50 feet of coax
from the antenna location at the top of the mast to the radio.  the loss in
signal is more than made up for by the line ofsight height advantage.  your
antenna should show some directivity on 2 meters and will definitely put
some energy out toward houston.  of course, if you are planning on working
into repeaters, you will do much better if your antenna is vertically
