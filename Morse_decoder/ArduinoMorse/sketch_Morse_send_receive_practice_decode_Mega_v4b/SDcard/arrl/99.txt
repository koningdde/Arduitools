pot was perfect.  i made the base out of a piece of 3/4 inch plywood that
was about 6 inches square.  i drilled a hole in the center of the plywood
with an adjustable hole saw, just large enough to provide a snug fit on the
outside of the launcher tube.  i also rounded the corners of the plywood
base.  on the bottom of the flowerpot, mark the center and concentric
points for four or five mounting screws.  use the hole saw to drill out the
flowerpot center to the same size as the tube or slightly larger.  then
drill clearance holes for the mounting screws see figure 4.  i used a scrap
piece of 2 x 4 for support inside the pot while drilling from the bottom.
center the pot on the plywood and attach it with some 1/2 or 3/4 inch sheet
metal screws.  a bead of hot melt glue between the pot and the plywood
