are shown in table 4.  i have two solid state amplifiers an ameritron als
600 and an elecraft kpa500.  both amplifiers put out full power into the
tuned antenna system on all bands from 80 to 10 meters i did, of course,
limit power to 200 w on 30 meters.  as pointed out in both manuals, i found
occurrences in which both auto tuners would not tune when changing bands.
this can occur if the tuning solution for the previous band results in a
very high swr on the new band, and more often happens when going from a
lower frequency band to a higher frequency band especially when using a
highly reactive antenna.  this very high swr can reflect all input power
from your transceiver, so the auto tuner cannot sense rf input power.  the
solution is to simply cycle power to the auto tuner when changing bands.
