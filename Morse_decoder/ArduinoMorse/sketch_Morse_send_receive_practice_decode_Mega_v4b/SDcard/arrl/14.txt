loading coil values.  coil inductance is adjusted by squeezing the turns
together more inductance or spreading them apart less inductance.  as you
might expect, changing the 20 meter settings also required some tweaking of
coils on the higher bands.  all told, it took a bit more than a half hour
of adjustment and checking to get the antenna tuned to where i wanted it.
the final settings are given in table 3.  the two 20 meter tuning positions
overlap enough to keep swr below 2 1 from the bottom of the band to about
14r300 mhz.  my rigs internal tuner easily handled the mismatch above
14r300 mhz.  since the q 52 is likely to be installed at low heights, near
roofs and buildings, and in the vicinity of other antennas, owners should
expect to have to adjust the antennas tuning on the lower bands, at least.
