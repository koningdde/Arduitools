really just a very closely spaced parallel conductor feed line.  by using
the right mix of ferrite, the choke will create enough impedance across the
hf range.  following the guidance of jim browns, k9yc, tutorials on
ferrites and chokes, i chose a 2r4 inch diameter 31 mix with a winding of
10 turns.  the ferrite tutorial estimates that the baluns choking impedance
at 7, 14, and 28 mhz is 3000, 3500, and 2000, respectively, as shown in
figure 1.  for the bifilar winding, i used twoconductor pvc insulated 16
zip cord which is fine for 100 w power levels.  if you plan on running high
power, use 12 or larger wire.  for this core you need about 3 inches of
wire per turn plus the connections at either end for a total of about 36
inches of wire, including the input and output connections.  the balun
