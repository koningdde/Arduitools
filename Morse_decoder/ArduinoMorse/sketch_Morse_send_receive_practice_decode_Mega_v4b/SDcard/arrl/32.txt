potential difference between pins 2 and 1.  the set coils were controlled
by either a two input nor gate or a single logic inverter.  if the logical
control signals caused an output potential to fall to zero the coil would
conduct a current of about 16 ma to ground causing the switch to close.
the three reed relay switches in figure 8 allowed element 1 to be connected
to either the lead feeder using logic terminal a, the central feeder with c
or d and the rear feeder with f.  this allowed the antenna element to
fulfill its correct role in any of the four directions of diagonal fire.
the relays latching capability allowed it to remember either state after
excitation of the coils had been removed.  any selection, set, operation
had always to be preceded by the reset operation.  the logical nor gates
