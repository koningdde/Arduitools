tape.  i use a fiberglass recurve bow of at least 40 pounds compound bows
will give you less control when shooting into lower trees and send the
arrow too far.  a line reel or loop is attached perpendicular to the bow
see figure 5.  the arrow is fed through the center for shooting.  i use the
metal lip of one of the reel supports to keep the line from unwinding until
shot.  in selecting a trajectory, i stand close to the trunk and shoot up
through the canopy and out into the open area on the antenna side, this way
there is less chance for the arrow to get caught in the tree.  after the
line is shot to a suitable location, a heavy nylon cord will have to be
pulled through, to be used to pull the halyard line.  for this i use a kite
string reel see figure 6 that can be found at toy stores or sporting goods
