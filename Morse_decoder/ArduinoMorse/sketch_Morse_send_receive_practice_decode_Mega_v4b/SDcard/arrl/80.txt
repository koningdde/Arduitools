spectraplus professional edition, version 5r0 software from pioneer hill
software.  the software allows postprocessing analysis in the time domain,
frequency domain, and variants of the frequency domain processing.  the
spectra software provides very accurate timing cursors to determine times
between events and event occurrence times.  my recorded data was digitized
to 16 bits.  spectra used a 4096 point fft to produce the results shown in
the spectrogram.  the data overlap was 90.  the time resolution was 8r63
ms, and each pixel is approximately 12 hz wide in frequency.  starting at
the far left of figure 2, the first event is the 60r9 ms dit transmission
period.  since the receiver is off, amplitude is depicted in dark blue.
moving to the right, the receiver is switched back on, and a field of green
