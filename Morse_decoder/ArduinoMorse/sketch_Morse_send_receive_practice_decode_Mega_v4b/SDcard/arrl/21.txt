most available non amateur headsets these days are wired for stereo
interconnection.  i chose to use a three conductor phone jack for the
headphones.  the ring and the tip are wired together at the jack so that
both sides of the headphones get the same audio signal.  phones with 1/4
inch jacks will plug in directly.  if you have a headset with a
subminiature plug, adapters to fit the stereo phone jacks are universally
available.  i used another rca phono jack for the receiver audio interface
j2.  older gear and even some recent gear will have a mono audio output, so
cable interfacing is simple.  more recent gear may have stereo output and
you need to check the wiring diagram to see what your options may be.  you
dont want to short out any audio signal on the ring so avoid using a mono
