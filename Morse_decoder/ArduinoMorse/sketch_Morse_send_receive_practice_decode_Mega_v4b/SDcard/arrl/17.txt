case a single pole single throw spst switch, can be used to select between
a unidirectional pattern or bidirectional pattern as shown.  this is
especially helpful at frequencies below 3 mhz where the sensitivity of the
array is much less than that of a single loop.  the switch can be
implemented as a manual or a relay switch directed by a remote control.
cabling for the enhanced array is shown in figure 13.  all cables are 75 rg
6 using type f connectors.  in this picture, the loop feed lines are shown
as connected to the switch module in this case, a remote controlled relay
switch.  the delay and reference lines are connected between the switch
module and the combiner amplifier.  the signal out line from the combiner
amplifier runs from the array to a receiver in the shack.  as mentioned
