built a very effective 10 band station his continuing success over more
than a decade shows his dedication.  once again jeff takes top honors with
373k, even after a 5760 mhz failure soon after the contest started.  this
is about half of his winning score in 2012, attesting to the generally poor
conditions experienced in most places.  the big news in sohp was jays,
w9rm, three band effort from dm58 co who moved up from 8th place last year
to take 2nd place in his second june vhf outing from his soon to be new
qth.  using only field daystyle antennas with a temporary setup in a pole
barn he racked up a great score of 230k, mostly on the merits of his 6
meter effort.  jay was a 6 meter operator at the now silent k9ns en52 il
limited multiop and says to watch out when he puts up some real antennas.
