antenna the radio is silent.  a that is a key distinction, because the cure
is quite different for the two cases.  to find out, insert, say, 10 db of
attenuation in the front end of your receiver many transceivers can do this
with a front panel button.  if the signal is coming from outside on the
receive frequency, it will drop by 10 db, or almost 2 s units.  if it is a
third order intermodulation product generated from off frequency signals
mixing within your receiver, it will drop by 3 x 10 db or 5 s units check
your s meter calibration on a known signal in the same band first.  if it
is a signal on your frequency, about the only hope is one of the cancelling
type noise reduction devices, although you may get some relief by turning
your beam to a null in the stations direction.  you also could try to
