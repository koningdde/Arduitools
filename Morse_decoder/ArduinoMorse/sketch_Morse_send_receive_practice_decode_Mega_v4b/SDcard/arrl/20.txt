through the software the thought process behind the pic software that is
loaded into the microcontroller of the interface project goes something
like this determine the operating mode desired from the setting of the mode
switch of the interface, either u/v uhf uplink/vhf downlink or v/u vhf
uplink/uhf downlink.  wait for and read valid frequency commands from
satpc32.  store the frequencies into temporary variables for vhf frequency
and uhf frequency as appropriate.  check the status of the ptt switch on
the interface board.  if the ptt switch is open in receive mode, send the
appropriate receive frequency to the 817 depends on the mode switch.  a1 go
back to step 1.  if the ptt switch is closed radio switched to transmit,
send a command to toggle the vfo and then sent the appropriate transmit
