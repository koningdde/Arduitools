indicator, and some the complete antenna impedance as a complex number that
looks like r jx.  to find the dipoles impedance, we need to put the r and x
values together as a complex number that is made up of three pieces the
first 4 is resistance and its real, the second is the operator / , and the
last, reactance, j1590 is imaginary.  you know that resistance is in ohms
and reactance is also in ohms.  ohms 1 ohms is nice and simple why not just
leave it at that?  why put the j in there to complicate things?  dont let
that imaginary j part bring back some terrible high school memories.
theres no test to worry about, so take a few deep breaths and chill out.
now, lets get real about the imaginary j.  a fundamental difference the j
is there to remind us of the fundamental difference between a resistance
