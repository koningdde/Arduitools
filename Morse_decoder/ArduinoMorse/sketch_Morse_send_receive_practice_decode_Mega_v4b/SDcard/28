I truly did not know this!
 
Las Vegas Churches accept gambling chips?

This may come as a surprise to those of you not living in Las Vegas , but there are more catholic churches
than casinos.

Not surprisingly, some worshipers at sunday services will give casino chips rather than cash when the basket
is passed.

Since they get chips from many different casinos, the churches have devised a method to collect the
offerings.

The churches send all their collected chips to a nearby franciscan monastery for sorting and then the chips are
taken to the casinos of origin and cashed in.

This is done by the chip monks.

You didn't even see it coming, did you?

GOTCHA!

Now it's your turn to tag someone else!
