A panda walks into an old western saloon. To the bartender's surprise, the panda plunks down a sack of gold
when he orders a sandwich and a root beer. Still, money is money, so the bartender serves the panda. The
panda eats the sandwich, chugs the root beer, draws a pistol, and shoots the piano player dead. Then it
stands and starts towards the door.

"Now hold on there, panda," says the bartender, pulling a shotgun from beneath the bar. "Nobody shoots my
piano player and just walks away."

The panda turns. "You got a dictionary?" it says.

"Yeah..." says the bartender.

"Then you should know better than to serve a panda. It's your own fault." And with that, the panda heads out
the door.

The bartender opens up his copy of webster's and flips to the P section. "Well I'll be danged," he says. "I
should have known better!"

The entry read: "Panda: A giant mammal native to China and central Asia. Eats shoots and leaves."
