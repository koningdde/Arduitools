The Pharmacist's Monday Morning

Upon arriving home, a husband was met at the door by his sobbing wife. Tearfully she explained,

"It's the druggist. He insulted me terribly this morning on the phone. I had to call multiple times before he
would even answer the phone."

Immediately, the husband drove downtown to confront the druggist and demand an apology.

Before he could say more than a word or two, the druggist told him,

"Now, just a minute, listen to my side of it. This morning the alarm Failed to go off, so I was late getting up.
I went without breakfast and Hurried out to the car, just to realize that I'd locked the house with both House
and car keys inside and had to break a window to get my keys.

"Then, driving a little too fast, I got a speeding ticket. Later, when I was About three blocks from the store, I
had a flat tire."

"When I finally got to the store a bunch of people were waiting for me to open up. I got the store opened and
started waiting on these people, all the time the darn phone was ringing off the hook."

He continued, "Then I had to break a roll of nickels against the cash register drawer to make change, and
they spilled all over the floor. I had to get down on my hands and knees to pick up the nickels and the phone
was still ringing. When I came up I cracked my head on the open cash drawer, which made me stagger back
against a showcase with a bunch of perfume bottles on it. Half of them hit the floor and broke."

"Meanwhile, the phone is still ringing with no let up, and I finally got back to answer it. It was your wife. She
wanted to know how to use a rectal thermometer.

And believe me mister, as God is my witness, all I did was tell her."
