Erections And Aging

Two old drunks are sitting in a bar when the first one says, "Ya know, when I was thirty and got an erection,
I couldn't bend it, even using both hands.

"By the time I was forty, I could bend it about ten degrees, if I tried really hard.

"By the time I was fifty, I could bend it about forty five degrees, no problem.

"I'm gonna be sixty next week, and now I can bend it in half with just one hand."

"So," says the second drunk, "what's your point?"

"Well, I'm just wondering how much stronger I'm gonna get."
