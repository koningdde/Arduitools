Skinny Dipping

An elderly man in Florida had owned a large farm for several years. He had a large pond in the back.

It was properly shaped for swimming, so he fixed it up nice with picnic tables, horseshoe courts, and some
orange, and lime trees.

One evening the old farmer decided to go down to the pond, as he hadn't been there for a while, and look it
over.

He grabbed a five-gallon bucket to bring back some fruit.

As he neared the pond, he heard voices shouting and laughing with glee.

As he came closer, he saw it was a bunch of young women skinny-dipping in his pond.

He made the women aware of his presence and they all went to the deep end.

One of the women shouted to him, "We're not coming out of this pond until you leave."

The old man frowned, "I didn't come down here to watch you ladies swim naked, or to make you get out of the
pond naked."

Holding the bucket up he said: "I'm just here to feed the alligator."

Some old men can still think fast.
