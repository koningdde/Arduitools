Drum Shell Shock
Newport, OR, USA
Type of Gig: bar

This is a 100% true story. Anyone that lives in Newport, Oregon can validate! Doing a early nineties rock bar
gig in Newport. The band was running sequencers, and hence a click-track for me, the drummer. I decided to
wire up an LED light to visually show me the click, instead of hearing it go snap, snap in my ears all night. 
I got a little black 'project box' from radio shack - the ONLY 'music store' in town. After stuffing in all the
required wires and gizmos to make this thing work, I taped it to a piece of pipe with black electrical tape and
mounted it to my drum rack. The result was a black plastic box taped to a piece of 2 inch pipe with a flashing
red LED that flashed to the beat of the click-track. I left it there laying on stage after load-out. 
A couple of extra beers during tear-down Saturday night, I simply forgot it.

The kitchen cook found it the next morning. He was a shell-shocked Vietnam Vet still a little excited about the
war 25 years ago. BOMB!!!

Fast-forward... When the Salem BOMB SQUAD showed up, I was long gone down the road headed to my next
gig in Spokane. the Bomb squad sent in the bomb robot not before shutting down the whole Newport
waterfront for 6 hours. The Robot did drop the device in a barrel and detonated it with their explosives. 
Blew it to bits. I got a very interesting call from my FRANTIC booking agent. It seems, the ATF was barreling down
interstate I-90 to arrest me as a terrorist. After a few hours answering questions in an ATF van on the side of
I-90, while agents completely emptied the contents of MY van on the side of the interstate, we all decided I
wasn't a terrorist at all.

I think I am still on some kind of watch list. I got a letter in the mail from the ATF stating The Salem Bomb
squad has my 'device' and I could come claim it after I pay a $7348.00 bill for their little 'visit' to Newport
Oregon. They can keep my click track.
