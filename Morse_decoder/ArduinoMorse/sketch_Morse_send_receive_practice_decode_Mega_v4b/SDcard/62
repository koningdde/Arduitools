A rather ignorant guy, after a long conversation with the wife, 
goes to a doctor's office to get a vasectomy.
He shows up in a limo wearing a tuxedo.
When it's his turn, the doctor looks at him and says,
"I've seen a lot of things, but I've never seen a guy coming in all dressed up like that!"
And the guy says, " Well, if I'm gonna be impotent, I'm gonna look impotent!"
