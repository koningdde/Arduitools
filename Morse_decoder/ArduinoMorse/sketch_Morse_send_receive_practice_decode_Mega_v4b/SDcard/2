Two sisters, one blonde and one brunette, inherit the family ranch. Unfortunately, after just a few years, they
are in financial trouble. In order to keep the bank from repossessing the ranch, they need to purchase a bull
so that they can breed their own stock. The brunette balances their checkbook, then takes their last $600
dollars out west to another ranch where a man has a prize bull for sale. Upon leaving, she tells her sister,
"When I get there, if I decide to buy the bull, I'll contact you to drive out after me and haul it home." The
brunette arrives at the man's ranch, inspects the bull, and decides she does want to buy it. The man tells her
that he can sell it for $599, no less.

After paying him, she drives to the nearest town to send her sister a telegram to tell her the news. She walks
into the telegraph office, and says, "I want to send a telegram to my sister telling her that I've bought a bull
for our ranch. I need her to hitch the trailer to our pick-up truck and drive out here so we can haul it home."
The telegraph operator explains that he'll be glad to help her, then adds, "It's just 99 cents a word." Well,
with only $1 left after paying for the bull, the brunette realizes that she'll only be able to send her sister one
word. After thinking for a few minutes, she nods, and says, "I want you to send her the word, 'comfortable.'"
The telegraph operator shakes his head. "How is she ever going to know that you want her to hitch the trailer
to your pick-up truck and drive out here to haul that bull back to your ranch if you send her the word,
'comfortable?'"

The brunette explains, "My sister's blonde. She'll read it slow and sound it out."

Come for da bull.
