Fantasy

The attractive young woman was sitting at the bar alone, when the lounge lizard made his move.
"I'm here," he breathed huskily, "to fulfil your every sexual fantasy."
The woman turned and looked at him.
Her lips parted and she moistened them with the tip of her tongue.
She leaned toward him with her hands on her thighs, and her eyes opened to the size of dinner plates.
She paused just a second and then delivered the crusher line,
"You've got a large donkey and a Doberman?"
The guy turned as green as his golf slacks and slipped away without a word!
