Gotta Love Those Italians

A Greek and an Italian were relaxing, conversing and sharing a bottle of wine.

As the conversation proceeds, the discussion leans toward which culture was superior.

The Greek brimming with pride states: "We Have The Parthenon!"

The Italian nods in agreement and arching his eyebrows replies: "We Have The Coliseum!"

The Greek not to be outdone responds: "We Greeks gave birth to Mathematics!"

The Italian, again nodding in agreement says: "We Built The Roman Empire!"

(The sparring between the two cultures goes on and on until...)

With an air of finality, The Greek, sits up straight, pulls his shoulders back, puffs his chest out and with a
flourish announces: "We Greeks Invented Sex!"

Without hesitation, the Italian again nodding in agreement answers: "That Is True!"

"But It Was We Italians Who Introduced It To Women!"
