A funny thing happened yesterday.

I was in Wal-Mart buying a large bag of Purina for my Labrador
Retriever and was in line to check out.

A woman behind me asked if I had a dog.

On impulse, I told her that no, I was starting The Purina Diet
again, although I probably shouldn't because I'd ended up in the
hospital last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in
an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices
and IVs in both arms.

I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way
that it works is to load your pants pockets with Purina nuggets and
simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry & that the food is
nutritionally complete so I was going to try it again.

I have to mention here that practically everyone in the line was by
now enthralled with my story.

Horrified, she asked if I'd been poisoned and was that why I was in
the hospital.

I said no, I'd been sitting in the street licking my balls and a
car hit me.
