Ancient Tech Support

The tech support problem dates back to long before the industrial revolution, when primitive tribesmen beat
out a rhythm on drums to communicate:

This fire help. Me Groog

Me Lorto. Help. Fire not work.

You have flint and stone?

Ugh

You hit them together?

Ugh

What happen?

Fire not work

(sigh) Make spark?

No spark, no fire, me confused. Fire work yesterday.

(sigh) You change rock?

I change nothing

You sure?

Me make one change. Stone hot so me soak in stream so stone not burn Lorto hand. Small change, shouldn't
keep Lorto from make fire.

WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!
