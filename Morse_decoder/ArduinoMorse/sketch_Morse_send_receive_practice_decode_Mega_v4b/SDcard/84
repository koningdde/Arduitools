The world's worst orchestra director was preparing his new group for their
first concert. Halfway through the first movement, as he conducted with wild
abandon, his baton flew out of his hand and impaled itself in the eye of a
flute player, killing her instantly.

The police investigated, but ruled her death an accident.

At the next rehearsal, he got caught up in the music again, lost his baton
again, and this time struck the bassoon player in the eye, killing him
instantly.

The police investigated, but again ruled the death an accident.

At the third rehearsal, the same thing happened, this time to a violinist.

The police could not believe that such an odd thing could happen three times
in a row accidentally, so they arrested the conductor. He was tried for triple
homicide and sentenced to death.

After all his appeals proved fruitless, the warden strapped him in the
electric chair and the officer in charge threw the giant electrical switch.

But nothing happened.

He turned it off and then back on again, but still nothing.

The exasperated warden yelled at the officer, "What are you doing wrong?"

The officer retorted, "Hey, don't blame me. Everyone knows he's a poor
conductor!"
