Hot Cross Buns

A general store owner hires a young female clerk with a penchant for wearing very short skirts and thong panties. 
One day, a young man enters the store, glances at the clerk, and glances at the loaves of bread behind the counter. 
Noticing the length of her skirt (or general lack thereof) and the location of the raisin bread, he has a brilliant idea. 
"I'd like some raisin bread, please," the man says politely.

The clerk nods and climbs up a ladder to reach the raisin bread, which is located on the very top shelf. 
The young man, standing almost directly beneath her, is provided with an excellent view, just as he had surmised he would be.

Once she descends the ladder he muses that he really should get 2 loaves as he is having company for dinner. 
As the clerk retrieves the 2nd loaf of bread, one of the other male customers notices what is going on. 
Thinking quickly, he quickly requests his own loaf of raisin bread so that he can continue to enjoy the view.

With each trip up the ladder the young lady seems to catch the eye of another male customer. 
Pretty soon each person is asking for raisin bread, just to see the clerk climb up and down.

After a few trips the clerk is tired and irritated and thinking that she is really going to have to try this raisin bread for herself.

Finally, once again atop the ladder, she stops and fumes, glaring at the men standing below. 
She notices an elderly man standing amongst the throng staring up at her.

Thinking to save herself a trip she yells, "Is yours raisin too?"

"No," croaks the feeble old man, "but it's startin' to twitch!"
