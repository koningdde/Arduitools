Blind man and two nuns

Two nuns are ordered to paint a room in the convent, and the last
instruction of the Mother Superior is that they must not get even a drop of
paint on their habits. After conferring about this for a while the two nuns
decide to lock the door of the room, strip off their habits, and paint
naked. In the middle of the project, there comes a knock at the door."Who
is it?" calls one of the nuns."Blind man," replies a voice from the other
side of the door.The two nuns look at each other and shrug both deciding
that no harm can come from letting a blind man into the room, they open the
door."Nice boobs," says the man, "Where do you want the blinds?"
