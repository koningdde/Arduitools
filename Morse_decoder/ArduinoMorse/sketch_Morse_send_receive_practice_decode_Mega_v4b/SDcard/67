A man and a woman were driving down the road arguing about his deplorable
infidelity. Suddenly, the woman reaches over and slices the man's penis off.
Angrily, she tosses it out the car window.

Driving behind the couple is a man and his 12 year old daughter. The little
girl is just chatting away at her father when, all of a sudden, the penis
smacks the pickup on the windshield, sticks for a moment, then flies off.

Surprised, the daughter asks her father, "Daddy, what the heck was that?"

Not wanting to expose his twelve year old daughter to anything sexual at such
a young age, the father replies, "It was only a bug, honey."

The daughter sits with a confused look on her face, and after a few minutes
she says, "Sure had a big dick, didn't it?"
