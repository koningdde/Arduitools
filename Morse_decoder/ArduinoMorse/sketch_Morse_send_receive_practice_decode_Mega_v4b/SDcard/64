10 Inch Pianist

 One day, a man walked into a bar. He say's to the bartender, "If I
 show you the most amazing thing in your life, will you give me
 five free beers?"

 The bartender says, "Show me this amazing thing first."

 So the man takes out a 10 inch man and a tiny piano.

 The 10 inch man starts playing the piano. The bartender scratches
 his head and says, "Wow, that is amazing. Here are your five
 beers. How did you do that?"

 "There is a magic lamp outside. Rub it and a genie comes out and
 will grant you one wish."

 So the bartender goes outside, finds the lamp, and rubs it. Then
 the genie comes out and says "I am the genie of this lamp. I will
 grant one wish. Choose carefully."

 "I want 10,000,000 bucks." As soon as he made his wish, 10,000,000
 ducks came out of nowhere.

 The bartender goes back into the bar.

 "Boy" he says to the man, "that genie sure does have bad hearing."

 The man answers: "I know, did you really think I asked for a 10
 inch pianist?"
