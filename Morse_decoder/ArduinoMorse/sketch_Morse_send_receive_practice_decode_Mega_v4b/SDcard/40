Police At The Door

The police came to my front door the other night holding a picture of my wife.

The Constable said "Is this your wife, sir?"

Shocked I answered "Yes."

He said, "I'm afraid I have to tell you that it looks like she's been hit by a bus."

I said, "I know, but she has a lovely personality and she's good with the kids."
