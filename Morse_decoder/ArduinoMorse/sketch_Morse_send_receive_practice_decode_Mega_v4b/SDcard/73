Martha recently lost her husband. She had him cremated and
brought his ashes home. Picking up the urn that he was in, she poured him
out on the patio table. Then, while tracing her fingers in the ashes,
she started talking to him.

"Herman, you know that fur coat you promised me? I bought it
with the insurance money!" She paused for a minute tracing her fingers in
the ashes then said,"

Herman, remember that new car you promised me?
Well, I also bought it with the insurance money! " Again, she
paused for a few minutes and while tracing her fingers in the ashes she
said, "Herman, that emerald necklace you promised me? Bought it too,
with the insurance money! Finally, still tracing her fingers in the
ashes, she said, "Herman, remember that blow job I promised you? ..here it
comes!"
