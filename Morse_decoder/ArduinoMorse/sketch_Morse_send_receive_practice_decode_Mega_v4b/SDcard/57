Two Nuns 

On Bikes

Two nuns are riding their bikes through town and are forced to take a detour.

One nun says to other, "I've never come this way before"

The other answers, "It's the cobblestones."

Driving In A Car

Two nuns are driving down a road late at night, when a vampire jumps on to the hood of their car.

"Quick!" the one nun says to the other, "show him your cross!"

So the other nun leans out the window and shouts,

"HEY! Get you’re ass off our fucking car!"
