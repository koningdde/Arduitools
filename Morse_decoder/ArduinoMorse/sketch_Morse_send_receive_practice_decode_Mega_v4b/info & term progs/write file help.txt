To write files through the Arduino I recommend Tera Term.
You can drag a file to it or use copy, right click.
When all bytes are transfered press ESC to close the file.
Set transfer delay to 1ms.

More info in other files.

or read below:

To write a textfile (w number), (without removing the SD card):
(for more help on this see 'wFilehlp.txt

Make the file in a text editor and make the last character char[129] or char[04].
This can be a problem. One solution is to make a batch file to do it.
Open a text editor and copy these two lines:
(or copy/paste the odd char after echo on the second line below to the end of your file)
(Grab it from this textfile. You may not see it on screen.)

@echo Adding an EOF marker to file: %1
@echo  >>%1

The bat file is included in the zip package.

Then save it as 129.bat and put it somewhere in the "path". (c:\windows\129.bat)
Run it this way from the command line. 129 textfile. Ex: 129 3
Your filenames will be JUST numbers! So your first file will be 0.
So...129 0 will put the End Of File marker at the end of your textfile.
Now find a terminal program that can send a textfile.
Tera Term works very well for this! It's free & small.
For your terminal monitor I recommend PuTTY Extra. It's free too.

For sending a file to the Arduino I suggest the free terminal program Tera Term:

NOTE: You can not have two terminal programs adress a port at the same time.
Use one terminal program to set the Arduino up to receive the file and to send it.
(you could also use a computer to put files on the SDcard. How 'bout that :-)

I use Windows and have little experience with Linux and no experience with the MAC system.
