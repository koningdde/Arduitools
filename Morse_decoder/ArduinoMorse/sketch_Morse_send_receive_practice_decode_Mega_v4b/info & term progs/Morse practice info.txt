Do you play with the Arduino Mega? Want to?
I have written a comprehensive code practice software for receive.
It also includes a send by paddle or straight key feature that checks your timing.
Too many features to list here!
You can download the whole package (zip) including parts list (5 or 7 items!)'
Includes where to get the parts, (cheap & no shipping charge),
and full software listing for Mega!

update! - now with a modified WB7FHC's Morse Code Decoder v.1.1 and a keyer

Requires computer terminal program for receive. No computer required for sending. 
(basic oscillator support for paddle & straight key + wpm adjust in software for battey operation)

All I want is some feedback if you try it.
